## Overview:

In my role as a Data Analyst at ElectroniTech Manufacturing Co., I had the privilege of working with seven datasets encompassing customer, employee, shipment status, shipment details, payment details, employee-managed shipments, and membership data. These datasets provide intricate insights into shipments and payments, offering a wealth of information such as shipment and payment IDs, customer and membership details, shipment contents, domains, service types, payment statuses, modes, and dates, as well as employee details and their efficacy in managing shipments. This comprehensive dataset enables in-depth analysis and visualization to unveil insights into shipment volumes, revenue contributions, customer behavior, and employee performance.

## Objective:

My objective in this project is to analyze ElectroniTech Manufacturing Co.'s operational datasets to extract insights regarding customer behavior, employee efficiency, shipment logistics, and financial transactions. I will utilize Excel to perform comprehensive data analysis, aiming to identify trends, inefficiencies, and potential areas for improvement within the company's operations. Key tasks will involve data cleaning and integration, detailed examination of customer and employee data, shipment tracking, financial analysis, and the creation of a dynamic dashboard to visualize crucial metrics. This project aims to streamline ElectroniTech Manufacturing Co.'s operations, optimize supply chain management, and bolster customer relations, ultimately facilitating strategic decision-making and fostering company growth.

## Steps Involved:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the new excel workbook and load the dataset with power query editor
3. Clean the data and change the datatype
4. Refresh the data to update the dashboard with the latest insights.
5. Explore the various visualizations and filters to gain insights.973

## Key Insights:

* Shipment Weight Distributions and Shipment Charges Analysis:

In terms of shipment weight, the majority falls within the range of 23 to 973 pounds, with only a small number exceeding 973 pounds.

Regarding shipment charges, for domestic shipments, the average shipment charges remain relatively consistent between regular and express delivery types. However, for international shipping, express delivery incurs higher shipping charges compared to regular delivery. 

* Employee Branches and Designation Analysis:

The largest portion of employees hails from the Texas branch, with New York, Illinois, California, and Ohio following suit. In terms of designation, Market Analysts constitute the highest number of employees, followed by Delivery Boys and IT Support Executives.

* Payment Type Distribution and Customer Segmentation Analysis:

Among payment modes, 53% of customers opt for Cash on Delivery (COD), while 47% choose card payments. Additionally, a significant portion of customers holds long-term memberships, with the highest average payment amount, followed by those with medium average payments under long-term memberships. Conversely, customers with short-term memberships and lower average payments represent the smallest proportion.
